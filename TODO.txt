For ACO:
    Generated first solution
    Some of these solutions are placing multiple lightbulbs around a 1 cell. This is not good, need to find out why but shouldn't stop ACO from doing it's thing (Will just generate incorrect solutions)
    Need to check the board for completion
    Update Pheromones
    Do ACO again until a correct solution is found

Fitness of Solution:
    To check the fitness of the solution a score will be given to each satisfied cell
    For black cells = 0
    For empty cells = 1
    For Lightbulbs = 1
    For Numbered Cells = 2
    This is totaled and then added to the Pheromones for that current path
